# Stepfile Arrow Position Randomizer

Randomizes arrow positions in (.sm) files for all (.sm) files in program directory and sub-directorries<br/>
Backups (.bak) of (.sm) files are created in case something goes wrong<br/>
Randomization is simple for now and simply prevents too many of the same arrows in a row<br/>
Only moves existing arrows around, you need to create the arrows first<br/>

HOW TO USE
1) Use ArrowVortex to create basic (.sm) file
2) Add steps and hold arrows following the beat of the song
3) Run the randomizer in the same directory as the file to randomize arrow positions
4) Copy the randomized ( your Stepmania Songs folder as usual

NOTES
You will need to reopen file in ArrowVortex to see the changes<br/>
You might need to force a reload of the file in Stepmania to see the changes<br/>
Press CTRL+SHIFT+R in selection screen while the song is selected<br/>

WARNING<br/>
In case something goes wrong, you can always use one of the .bak files<br/>
Simply remove the .001.bak to have your .sm file once again<br/>

DO NOT RUN THIS INSIDE YOUR MAIN STEPMANIA SONGS FOLDER THIS WILL RANDOMIZE ALL YOUR SONGS
UNDOING THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED<br/>
I suggest you work in a folder on your desktop just in case<br/>
I suggest you keep your original (.sm) ifle with beats to do quick beat edits until you are done<br/>
You can simply run the randomizer again to test new patterns<br/>
